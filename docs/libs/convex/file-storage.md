File Storage makes it easy to implement file upload in your app, store files from and send files to third-party APIs, and to serve dynamic files to your users. All file types are supported.

*   [Upload](/file-storage/upload-files) files to store them in Convex and reference them in your database documents
*   [Store](/file-storage/store-files) files generated or fetched from third-party APIs
*   [Serve](/file-storage/serve-files) files via URL
*   [Delete](/file-storage/delete-files) files stored in Convex
*   Access file [metadata](/file-storage/file-metadata)

You can manage your stored files on the [dashboard](/dashboard/deployments/file-storage).
