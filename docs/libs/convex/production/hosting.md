The easiest way to publish your full-stack web app is to use a hosting provider like [Vercel](https://vercel.com) or [Netlify](https://netlify.com).

Both Vercel and Netlify integrate with Git to deploy code whenever a new revision is pushed. To host your app:

1.  Commit all files and push to your favorite Git hosting provider such as [GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/).
    
2.  Follow the appropriate guide below.
    

If you aren't using Netlify or Vercel, you can follow the Custom Hosting guide.

*   [Vercel](/production/hosting/vercel)
*   [Netlify](/production/hosting/netlify)
*   [Custom Hosting](/production/hosting/custom)
